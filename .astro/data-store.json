After the entire HIL test fixture had been assembled and was operating as expected, there were three main points of improvement. First, the switches were too small and soldered too close together which made it difficult to operate one without affecting another. Second, the LCD was also tilted at an angle that made it difficult to see when standing above the test fixture.

The enclosure was separated into a bottom half and top half. The bottom half of the enclosure had mounts for the protoboard and CAN module, a hole on the rear side for output wires, and a lot of extra space to keep all internal wires contained. To maximize user experience, the new, larger switches were sourced with the final approval from the engineers at Electrans since they would be operating the fixture.
