## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React Native for cross-platform development
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
- **Charts**: Victory Native for data visualization
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging

## Development Challenges

One of the main challenges was creating a smooth, native-feeling experience across both iOS and Android platforms while maintaining a single codebase. We achieved this through careful platform-specific optimizations and extensive testing.

## User Impact

The app has gained over 50,000 active users with an average rating of 4.8 stars on both app stores. Users report increased motivation and better fitness outcomes.
